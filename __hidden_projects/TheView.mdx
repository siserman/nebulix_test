## The View

[https://youtu.be/LFzO1hm4MZo](https://youtu.be/LFzO1hm4MZo)

**Platform:** Oculus Quest 2

**Development Tool:** Unity3D

**Client:** A Netherlands-based investor-funded company

**Project Timeline:** 2 weeks

**Project Overview:**
"The View" is a sophisticated video player app developed for the Oculus Quest 2, designed to create a luxurious and immersive video viewing experience. Developed in a rapid two-week timeline, this project was a critical pitch to secure further funding from investors in Dubai, which it successfully achieved.

**Design and Aesthetic:**
The app's environment was meticulously crafted to evoke the opulence and modernity associated with Dubai. Organic shapes and gold elements were integrated throughout the virtual space, creating a sense of elegance and luxury. The backdrop was a stunning sky, further enhancing the immersive feel and providing a perfect setting for displaying 360-degree videos.

**Innovative Video Player:**
Central to "The View" was its ability to showcase immersive 360-degree videos within the VR environment. This feature transformed the Oculus Quest 2 into a powerful tool for experiencing video content in a completely new and engaging way, making the viewer feel as though they were part of the scene.

**Interactive Element - Sirk:**
A unique aspect of the app was Sirk, a hand-sized spherical robot that functioned as a virtual guide. Sirk could fly around the environment, interact with users, and assist in navigating the app. This playful element added a touch of whimsy and interactivity, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Technical Achievement:**
Completing such a complex and high-quality project in just two weeks was a remarkable feat, showcasing my proficiency in Unity3D and my ability to deliver under tight deadlines. The project's success in advancing to the next round of funding highlighted its excellence in design, functionality, and overall appeal.

**Conclusion:**
"The View" stands as a testament to the power of immersive technology to create captivating experiences. It's not just a video player; it's a gateway to a world of luxury and innovation, where every element is carefully crafted to transport the user into a realm of elegance and interactivity. This project underscored my ability to merge artistic vision with technical expertise, delivering a product that resonates with investors and users alike.
