## Trilux HCL Interactive Experience

[https://youtu.be/IwP5fYGj8vk](https://youtu.be/IwP5fYGj8vk)

**Client:** Trilux

**Collaboration:** DCC Ruhr AG

**Technology Used:** Augmented Reality (AR)

**Project Title:** Trilux HCL Interactive Experience

**Innovative Concept and Design:**
Developed for Trilux, this application centered around Human Centric Lighting (HCL) showcased a pioneering approach to lighting technology. The concept was to create an interactive experience where users could explore the impact of lighting on an office environment throughout the day. Using a physical rotational knob, users could seamlessly transition the virtual office scene from dawn to dusk, witnessing the adaptive capabilities of Trilux lighting in real-time.

**User Interaction and Engagement:**
The app was designed with user engagement at its core. The physical knob provided a tactile, intuitive control mechanism, allowing users to effortlessly alter the time of day within the virtual office scene. This hands-on approach not only made the experience more engaging but also helped in demonstrating the practical application of HCL in everyday settings, emphasizing the user-centric design philosophy of Trilux.

**Technological Integration and Development:**
The development of the app involved integrating advanced lighting simulation within a virtual environment. The challenge was to accurately represent the changing light temperatures and intensities in real-time, corresponding to the user's input. This required a deep understanding of both lighting technology and interactive software development, ensuring a smooth and realistic user experience.

**Educational Value and Market Impact:**
Beyond its interactive features, the app served an educational purpose, illustrating the benefits of HCL in workplace environments. By experiencing the changes in lighting and its effects on the virtual space, users gained insights into how proper lighting can enhance mood, comfort, and productivity. This experience not only reinforced Trilux's position as an innovator in lighting solutions but also educated potential customers about the tangible benefits of HCL in modern workplaces.
