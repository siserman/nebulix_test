## Mercedes-Benz EQ SUV VR Experience

**Client:** Mercedes-Benz

**Agency:** MadHat GmbH in collaboration with Markgraph

**Event:** Geneva Car Salon 2017

**Year of Development:** 2017

**Project Overview:**
In 2017, for the esteemed Geneva Car Salon, I developed a VR experience for Mercedes-Benz, showcasing their first electric car prototype, the EQ SUV. Collaborating with MadHat GmbH and Markgraph, this project aimed to highlight the innovative features of the EQ SUV through a captivating virtual reality journey.

**Futuristic City Drive:**
The VR experience offered a semi-interactive drive through a futuristic cityscape. Users, in a third-person view, followed the EQ SUV as it navigated through this digitally-rendered environment. This perspective not only showcased the sleek design of the vehicle but also provided a dynamic backdrop to highlight its capabilities and features.

**Highlighting Innovations:**
Key features of the EQ SUV, such as its impressive range, advanced chassis technology, and innovative charging stations, were intricately integrated into the VR narrative. These aspects were highlighted in a manner that was both informative and visually engaging, offering users a deep dive into the technological advancements that set the EQ SUV apart.

**Interactive Elements:**
The experience was designed to be immersive and user-friendly, with interactive elements that allowed users to explore the EQ SUV's features in detail. This interactive approach made the experience more engaging, providing users with a sense of control and involvement in the exploration of the vehicle.

**Integration of Film Footage:**
A distinctive feature of the app was the integration of film footage featuring a host who introduced users to the VR experience. This inclusion added a personal touch, guiding users through the experience and enhancing the overall narrative flow.

**Conclusion:**
The Mercedes-Benz EQ SUV VR Experience for the Geneva Car Salon 2017 was a pioneering project that blended the novelty of electric cars with the emerging technology of virtual reality. It not only showcased the EQ SUV in an innovative and engaging manner but also set a new standard for automotive presentations at industry conventions. The project was a testament to the potential of VR as a powerful tool for immersive storytelling and product showcasing in the automotive industry.
