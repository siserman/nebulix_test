### 3D Ship Configurator for Ozean Engineering

[https://youtu.be/TO2tPMAgFVQ](https://youtu.be/TO2tPMAgFVQ)

**The Challenge:**

Ozean Engineering, a naval architecture firm with over 43 years of maritime excellence, needed an interactive way for clients to explore and configure their vessel designs. The goal was to create a tool that would bring their ship designs to life while streamlining the sales process.

**AI-Accelerated Development:**

This project showcases the power of AI-assisted development in achieving rapid iteration times. By leveraging AI coding tools, the development cycle was dramatically compressed, allowing for quick prototyping, real-time adjustments, and fast deployment of new features. What traditionally would take months was accomplished in a fraction of the time, without compromising on quality or functionality.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time 3D Visualization:** Explore vessel designs from any angle with smooth WebGL-powered graphics
- **Interactive Configuration:** Customize ship specifications including dimensions, propulsion systems, and sustainability options
- **PDF Export:** Generate professional specification documents directly from the configurator for client presentations and quotations
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across desktop and tablet devices

**Vessel Types:**

The configurator supports Ozean Engineering's core vessel categories:
- Multi-purpose vessels (e.g., 9500 TDW MPP with methanol-ready propulsion)
- River-going coasters (e.g., 2950 TDW with biofuel-ready systems)
- Container and heavy-lift ships (with wind-assisted options)

**Sustainability Focus:**

Aligned with Ozean Engineering's commitment to IMO 2050 climate compliance, the configurator highlights sustainable options including hydrogen-ready engines, battery systems, and decarbonization features.

**Team:**

This project was developed in collaboration with [Arne Meier of MRDSN](https://www.meierdesigns.de/), combining expertise in 3D visualization and UI/UX design.
