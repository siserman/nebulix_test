## Interactive 3D Printed E-Car Charging Station Exhibit

**Project Overview:**
In 2023, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Atelier Markgraph on a groundbreaking project for Mercedes-Benz. We created an interactive exhibit featuring a 3D printed model of Mercedes-Benz's latest electric car charging station.

**Technical Innovation:**
Utilizing the advanced capabilities of Unity and VisionLib, we developed an augmented reality experience that allowed users to explore the charging station in detail. Visitors used iPads to track the 3D printed model, upon which dynamic and informative 3D elements were overlaid.

**Interactive Experience:**
The project was designed to be highly interactive and educational. Users could view intricate details of the charging station and learn about Mercedes-Benz's innovative features through engaging 3D animations and visualizations. The AR experience highlighted the station's efficiency, design, and technological advancements.

**Impact:**
This exhibit not only showcased the cutting-edge technology of Mercedes-Benz but also demonstrated the potential of AR in enhancing educational and promotional experiences. The project received acclaim for its interactive approach and the seamless integration of physical and digital elements.
