## Price Waterhouse Coopers VR Experience

**Collaboration:** Christian Zajac

**Client:** Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC)

**Year:** 2018

**Technology Used:** Unity, Substance Painter

**Project Overview:**
In 2018, I collaborated with Christian Zajac to create an immersive VR experience for the employees of Price Waterhouse Coopers. This project was designed to take users on a journey through the history of auditing, spanning its past, present, and envisioned future. Developed in Unity, my primary responsibility was to craft high-performance, visually appealing environments and assets.

**Historical and Futuristic Environments:**
The VR experience was segmented into different eras of auditing history. Each segment required a unique environment that accurately reflected the time period. From recreating historical settings to imagining futuristic scenarios, the project demanded a versatile approach to environment design.

**Highlight Asset - Ancient Mechanical Calculator:**
A notable feature of the VR experience was the detailed recreation of an ancient mechanical calculator, a crucial tool in the history of auditing. This asset was created using Substance Painter, ensuring a high level of detail and authenticity. It served not only as a visual centerpiece but also as an educational tool, giving users a tangible connection to the auditing practices of the past.

**Performance and Aesthetics:**
A major challenge was balancing high-quality graphics with the performance constraints of VR. Meticulous optimization techniques were employed to ensure that the environments and assets were not only visually impressive but also performed smoothly in a VR setting.

**Educational Impact:**
The VR experience was designed to educate PwC employees about the evolution of their field in an engaging and interactive manner. By immersing users in different eras, the project provided a unique perspective on the progression of auditing practices and technologies.

**Conclusion:**
The Price Waterhouse Coopers VR Experience represented a successful blend of historical education and technological innovation. The project demonstrated my expertise in creating detailed and performance-optimized assets and environments in VR, contributing significantly to the understanding and appreciation of the auditing professionâ€™s history and future among PwC employees.
