At the core of the Päcker's design is a commitment to versatility and sustainability. Leveraging the latest in 3D printing technology, each component of the Päcker was meticulously designed to be lightweight, durable, and most importantly, eco-friendly. The use of recycled materials and a decentralized production approach not only reduced the environmental footprint but also allowed for unprecedented customization and ease of repair.

The Päcker boasts a myriad of features that set it apart in the realm of urban mobility solutions. Its convertible design effortlessly transitions from a robust bike trailer to a sturdy sack cart, catering to various urban scenarios. The focus on security, with a design that minimizes the risk of theft, and the commitment to affordability, offering a cost-effective alternative to cargo bikes, are just a few of the thoughtful considerations in its development.
