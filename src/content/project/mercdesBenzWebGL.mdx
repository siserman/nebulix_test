## Mercedes-Benz Factory Production Process WebGL Prototype

**Client:** Mercedes-Benz

**Collaborators:** Younkyu Ko and Group of People Agency

**Technology Used:** Unity for WebGL

**Project Overview:**
This project involved the creation of a WebGL prototype for Mercedes-Benz, developed in collaboration with Younkyu Ko and Group of People Agency. The objective was to design an interactive diagram solution that accurately and engagingly showcased the production process within a Mercedes-Benz factory.

**Development and Features:**
Using Unity, we crafted an interactive web-based application that allowed users to explore the various stages of the car production process. The prototype featured detailed diagrams and animations that provided insights into each step, from initial design to final assembly. The interactive elements were designed to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly experience, making complex manufacturing processes accessible and understandable.

**Challenge and Outcome:**
Despite our efforts to create a detailed and functional prototype, the project ultimately did not align with the client's expectations and was subsequently rejected. This outcome, while disappointing, provided valuable learning experiences in client communication, project management, and technical execution.

**Reflection and Learning:**
The rejection of the prototype served as an important reminder of the challenges inherent in aligning creative visions with client expectations. It highlighted the importance of continuous dialogue and feedback during the development process. This experience reinforced the need for adaptability and resilience in the face of setbacks and has been instrumental in refining our approach to similar projects in the future.

**Conclusion:**
The Mercedes-Benz Factory Production Process WebGL Prototype, despite its rejection, was a significant endeavor that pushed the boundaries of interactive web-based solutions. The project underscored our commitment to innovation and our ability to tackle complex technical challenges. It stands as a testament to our dedication to exploring new technologies and approaches, even in the face of challenges, and continues to inform our work in the digital and interactive media space.
