While the style of the animation might now be considered a bit dated, it still holds up to today's standards in terms of clarity, coherence, and visual appeal. The project showcased a keen eye for detail and an understanding of how to convey complex product information in an accessible and engaging format.

**Skill Development and Passion:**
Creating the Cybex Aton animation was a significant learning experience, allowing me to develop and refine skills that would become crucial in my later work. It was a project that not only demonstrated my technical abilities but also my enthusiasm for bringing products to life through 3D animation.
