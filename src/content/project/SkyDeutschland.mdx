## Motion Designer at Sky Deutschland (Sky Creative Services)

[https://youtu.be/L3WmJVGsXD8?si=n2Mw_bqMrpdjrHdy](https://youtu.be/L3WmJVGsXD8?si=n2Mw_bqMrpdjrHdy)

**Tenure:** 2010 - 2012

**Overview:**
I embarked on my journey with Sky Deutschland's Creative Services team in 2010, a time that marked the inception of my career as a professional designer. This role not only provided me with a formidable foundation in the high-octane world of TV production design but also led to a significant personal and professional revelation about the nature of 3D design.

**High-Pressure Learning Environment:**
The years 2010 to 2012 at Sky Deutschland were a period of intense learning and growth. Working in a fast-paced and deadline-driven environment, I honed my skills in design under the pressure of TV production's demanding timelines. This setting was instrumental in cultivating my discipline, attention to detail, and the ability to navigate and thrive in a high-pressure workplace.

**Moment of Enlightenment:**
A pivotal moment during my tenure was the realization that true 3D design reveals its full potential in real-time rendering. This epiphany shaped my approach to 3D design, steering my focus towards real-time 3D as the most genuine and dynamic form of this art. This insight was more than just a professional adjustment; it was an enlightenment that would guide my career trajectory henceforth.

**End of an Era:**
In 2023, I received the news of the closure of Sky Creative Services with a sense of sadness. Reflecting on my time there, I feel a profound gratitude for the experiences and lessons it offered. The end of Sky Creative Services marks the close of a significant chapter in the history of TV production design, one that I am proud to have been a part of.

**Conclusion:**
My journey with Sky Deutschland from 2010 to 2012 was more than just the early stages of my career; it was a period of profound professional development and personal discovery. The realization that real-time 3D is the essence of true 3D design has been a guiding light in my subsequent endeavors. The closure of Sky Creative Services in 2023 is a poignant reminder of the transient nature of the industry and the lasting impact such experiences can have on one's career and outlook.
