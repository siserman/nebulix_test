**The Challenge:**

Rotpunkt Küchen, a premium German kitchen manufacturer known for their high-quality craftsmanship and sustainable production, needed an interactive way for customers to visualize and configure their kitchen designs. The goal was to create an intuitive tool that would bring their extensive product range to life while simplifying the sales process for dealers worldwide.

**AI-Accelerated Development:**

This project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development in achieving rapid iteration times. By leveraging AI coding tools, the development cycle was dramatically compressed, allowing for quick prototyping, real-time adjustments, and fast deployment of new features. Complex functionality that traditionally would require extensive development time was accomplished efficiently without compromising on quality.

**Key Features:**

- **Real-time 3D Visualization:** Explore kitchen designs from any angle with smooth WebGL-powered graphics
- **Interactive Configuration:** Customize cabinet layouts, materials, colors, and appliance placements
- **Multi-language PDF Export:** Generate professional specification documents in multiple languages for international dealers
- **Website Integration:** Seamlessly embedded within the Rotpunkt website for a cohesive user experience
- **Responsive Design:** Works across desktop and tablet devices

**Technical Implementation:**

Built with Unity3D and deployed as a WebGL application, the configurator handles complex 3D rendering while maintaining smooth performance in the browser. The multi-language PDF generation system ensures that dealers across different markets can provide localized documentation to their customers.
