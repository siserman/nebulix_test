## The Urban Mobility Challenge

Living in the city presents a unique set of challenges when it comes to transporting goods. Whether it's a weekly grocery run, picking up packages, or moving bulky items, urban dwellers often face a difficult choice: use a car (expensive, polluting, parking nightmares) or struggle with inadequate solutions like backpacks and shopping bags.

**PAKKER was born from this frustration.**

## A Dual-Mode Solution

What makes PAKKER unique is its seamless transformation between two modes:

1. **Bike Trailer Mode** - Attach it to any standard bicycle and transport up to 50kg of cargo effortlessly
2. **Hand Truck Mode** - Detach and convert in seconds (no tools required!) to handle up to 120kg as a sturdy hand truck

This dual functionality means you're never stuck with the wrong tool for the job. Need to bike to the store but navigate through a crowded market? No problem. PAKKER adapts to your needs.

## Built for the Real World

We didn't just design PAKKER on paper - we built it to handle real urban conditions:

- **Weight:** Approximately 8.8kg - light enough to handle easily
- **Folded Size:** ~60 x 40cm - fits in your hallway or car trunk
- **Assembly:** ~30 seconds from folded to ready
- **Compatibility:** Universal coupling works with all standard bicycles
- **Euro Box Ready:** Optimized for 600x400mm European cargo boxes

## Sustainable Manufacturing

PAKKER represents a new approach to product manufacturing:

**3D Printing at the Core** - Each component is designed for 3D printing, enabling:
- Decentralized production (print locally, reduce shipping)
- Easy repairs (print replacement parts yourself)
- Continuous improvement (updates can be pushed digitally)
- Recycled materials compatibility
